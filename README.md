Interview Scheduler App üóìÔ∏èThis is a React-based web application designed to simplify the process of scheduling interviews between an interviewer and multiple job applicants. It helps you manage interviewer availability, add applicant details, find common time slots, and generate a clear interview schedule. Data persists locally, and you can easily import applicants from a CSV file and export the final schedule.‚ú® FeaturesInterviewer Availability Setup: Define the interviewer's weekly working hours (Monday to Friday) with multiple time slots per day.Applicant Management:Manually add new applicants with their names and individual weekly availability.Edit existing applicant details and availability.Delete individual applicants.Clear all applicants at once.Import Applicants from CSV: Upload a CSV file to quickly add multiple applicants, including their names and detailed availability across the week.Automatic Schedule Generation: Based on interviewer and applicant availability, the app automatically generates an optimal interview schedule.Configurable Schedule Parameters: Adjust the interview duration (e.g., 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes) and the number of interviewers available (e.g., 1 or 2) to regenerate the schedule dynamically.Schedule Results View:Displays matched applicants in organized time slots per day.Lists any applicants who could not be matched due to conflicting availability.Data Persistence: All interviewer availability and applicant data are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so your information remains even after you refresh or close the tab.Clear All Data: A dedicated button to completely reset all saved data (interviewer, applicants, and schedule) from local storage.Export Schedule to CSV: Download the generated interview schedule as a CSV file for easy sharing or record-keeping. The export includes all time slots and assigned applicants, as well as a list of unmatched applicants.üõ†Ô∏è Technologies UsedReact: For building the user interface.Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling and responsive design.Lucide React: For beautiful, customizable icons.üöÄ Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.PrerequisitesNode.js (LTS version recommended)npm or YarnInstallationClone the repository (or download the code files):git clone <your-repository-url>
